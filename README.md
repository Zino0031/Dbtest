# Movie Rating System

## Language and Database Used
- **Language:** Python (Flask) for backend, Nextjs for frontend


## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Create a virtual environment: `python3 -m venv venv`.
3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
   - On macOS/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`
4. Install dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.yaml`.
5. Start the Flask server by running `python app.py`.
6. The backend API will be available at `http://localhost:5000`.
7. Install dependencies by running `npm install`.
8. Start the development server by running `npm start`.
9. Access the frontend application at `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.



## Assumptions Made
- The backend API endpoints for authentication, movie listing, movie addition, and rating submission are implemented using Flask.
- The frontend interacts with the backend using RESTful API calls.
- Basic error handling is implemented for API requests.


## Problem Solved
- Implemented a frontend interface to test data for movies system with the following features:
  - User login
  - Adding a movie
  - Viewing a list of all movies
Note : for the others you can test them by using POSTMAN or cURL
